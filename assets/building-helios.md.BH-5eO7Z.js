Each document can have a different structure, allowing for schema flexibility. Many document databases are designed for horizontal scaling and quick read access for contiguous pieces of data.</p><p>While document databases offer schema flexibility, we require our data to have a consistent structure, making schema flexibility a liability rather than an asset. In addition, they don‚Äôt align with our needs for high-performance analytical queries across large datasets. Please see our benchmarking section for performance metrics.</p><h3 id="row-based-storage" tabindex="-1">Row-based Storage <a class="header-anchor" href="#row-based-storage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Row-based Storage&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Relational databases such as Postgres and MySQL use row-based storage. It is the conventional method of storing data, where each row is treated as a primary unit and is sequentially stored on the disk. A key characteristic of row-based storage includes efficient transactions, particularly in regards to record updates and deletions.</p><p>However, row-based storage is often inefficient when it comes to analytical queries, especially those that require an aggregation of data over a few columns. In these queries, the database must read entire rows of data even when only a subset of columns are needed.</p><p>The following is a basic event table along with a basic analytic query that asks the question ‚ÄúHow many events has each user initiated?‚Äù</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="Event Table"></p><p>Below is an example of how row-based databases might execute an analytical query:</p><h5 id="" tabindex="-1"><img src="'+h+'" alt="Row Table"> <a class="header-anchor" href="#" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;![Row Table](public/case_study/rowbased.png)&quot;">‚Äã</a></h5><h5 id="-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;">‚Äã</a></h5><h3 id="column-based-storage" tabindex="-1">Column-based Storage <a class="header-anchor" href="#column-based-storage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Column-based Storage&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Columnar databases such as Clickhouse and Apache Druid use column-based storage. The key difference is that columns are treated as the primary unit and stored sequentially on the disk. When running queries that span only a few columns, a columnar database can ignore unneeded columns. Additionally, columns can be compressed more efficiently than rows, leading to better storage efficiency and speed. More performance details can be found in our <a href="./load-testing#benchmarking">Benchmarking</a> section.</p><p>Below is an example of how column-based databases might execute an analytical query:</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Column Table"></p><p>One key limitation is that the data in a columnar database is not well-suited for frequent updates or deletions of existing data. Fortunately, this drawback should not be limiting for Helios users. By nature, many real-time streaming data use-cases mostly require database reads and insertions that do not modify existing data.</p><p>After evaluating these database types, it was clear that columnar-based storage is the best fit for analytical queries.</p><h3 id="why-clickhouse" tabindex="-1">Why Clickhouse <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-clickhouse" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Clickhouse&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>After deciding on a columnar database, we evaluated a number of database options and ultimately selected Clickhouse as our preferred choice because it met all of our original criteria plus had a few extra standout benefits:</p>',19),C={class:"icon-list"},q=e("span",null,"High write throughput",-1),x=e("span",null,"Low-latency query performance",-1),T=e("span",null,"Comprehensive Documentation",-1),S=e("span",null,"Open Source",-1),P=s('<p>Of the criteria listed above, ClickHouse&#39;s impressive read and write latency particularly impressed us.

While many database deployments utilize clustered architectures for high availability and scalability, with modern implementations often leveraging containerization and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, we found this approach less suitable for ClickHouse.</p><p>Contrary to the typical horizontal scaling strategy for other database types like Druid, the ClickHouse development team specifically advises against premature horizontal scaling. Their recommendation stems from ClickHouse&#39;s design, which is optimized for efficient performance on a single server, even at scales of hundreds of billions of rows.

Each of these can be parallelized independently and will, by default, use as many <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/settings/settings/#settings-max_threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">threads as cores</a>, thus utilizing the full machine resources for a query.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Key factors in our decision-making process included:</p>',8),A={class:"icon-list"},H=e("span",null,"Performance optimization: ClickHouse can efficiently handle massive datasets on a single server",-1),I=e("span",null,"Simplicity: Reduced complexity in deployment and management compared to a clustered setup.",-1),B=e("span",null,"Cost-effectiveness: Maximizing resource utilization before scaling horizontally.",-1),D=e("span",null,"Scalability: Ensuring our architecture can still accommodate future growth when necessary.",-1),L=s('<p>Based on these considerations, we opted to host ClickHouse on an Amazon EC2 virtual server with Elastic Block Storage (EBS).

When a request comes in, AWS must allocate a worker from this EC2 pool to handle it. This allocation process involves initializing the execution environment and loading a module containing the provided function code. This setup process explains why cold starts occur, introducing a brief delay before the function can begin processing the request.</p><p>This prep time setting up the execution environment, a cold start, is not charged, but it adds latency to the Lambda invocation.
