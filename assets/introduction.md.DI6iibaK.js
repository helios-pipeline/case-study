Our automated deployment process and intuitive interface allow teams to query and gain insights from their existing event streams.</p><p>In this case study, we will describe why we built Helios, the architecture and specific trade-offs made, technical challenges we encountered and improvements we made along the way.</p><h2 id="problem-domain" tabindex="-1">Problem Domain <a class="header-anchor" href="#problem-domain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Problem Domain&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In today&#39;s data-driven landscape, teams increasingly rely on real-time event streams to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, the sheer volume and velocity of these streams often present significant challenges for extracting meaningful information, including viewing raw event data, performing ad-hoc analysis, and debugging events in real-time. These difficulties are particularly pronounced when using popular event streaming platforms like Amazon Kinesis, which offer limited native tools for data exploration and analysis. To fully appreciate the context in which Helios operates and the problems it aims to solve, it&#39;s essential to first understand some fundamental concepts related to events and event streaming.</p><h3 id="fundamental-background" tabindex="-1">Fundamental Background <a class="header-anchor" href="#fundamental-background" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fundamental Background&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="events" tabindex="-1">Events <a class="header-anchor" href="#events" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Events&quot;">​</a></h4><p>An <strong>event</strong> is a state change in a system or application. This could be as simple as a user clicking a button or as complex as a critical system update.</p><blockquote><p>“[An event is] a small, self-contained, immutable object containing the details of something that happened at some point in time … [it] might be an action that a user took, such as viewing a page or making a purchase. It might also originate from a machine, such as a periodic measurement from a temperature sensor, or a CPU utilization metric.” - DDIA</p></blockquote><h4 id="event-streaming" tabindex="-1">Event streaming <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-streaming" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event streaming&quot;">​</a></h4><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Event Streaming"></p><p><strong>Event streaming</strong> is the continuous transmission and processing of events from various sources in real-time or near real-time. <strong>Real-time</strong> has different meanings depending on the context. For instance, in high-frequency trading, real-time might mean microseconds, whereas in social media analytics, it could mean within a few minutes. In this case study, we define real-time as end-to-end latency within 5 seconds from event consumption by Helios from a streaming platform to event data being available for querying. This definition is based on our load testing, which will be detailed later in this case study.</p><p>In event streaming architecture, events are generated by <strong>producers</strong>, for example a web application which produces user click events, and can be processed by multiple <strong>consumers</strong>. A consumer is an entity that receives and processes messages or events from one or more streams. <strong>Brokers</strong> are the intermediary that receives, stores and distributes events (e.g. queues).</p><h5 id="event-streaming-platforms" tabindex="-1">Event Streaming Platforms <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-streaming-platforms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event Streaming Platforms&quot;">​</a></h5><p><strong>Event streaming platforms</strong> act like a broker in that they receive events from producers and can have multiple consumers. Popular event streaming platforms include Apache Kafka, Google Pub/Sub, and Amazon Kinesis.</p><p>The defining characteristics of event streaming are its real-time nature - where data is processed as it arrives rather than being stored for later analysis, its continuity - with data being constantly added to the stream, and its unboundedness - meaning the total size of the data is unknown and potentially infinite.</p><h5 id="event-streaming-use-cases" tabindex="-1">Event streaming use cases <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-streaming-use-cases" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event streaming use cases&quot;">​</a></h5><p>Event streaming serves a variety of functions, including:</p>',18),_={class:"icon-list"},w=i('<h3 id="event-streaming-platform-limitations" tabindex="-1">Event Streaming Platform Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-streaming-platform-limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event Streaming Platform Limitations&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While event streaming platforms excel at ingesting and processing high-volume, real-time data, they present a significant challenge for data analysis and exploration: data accessibility. Event streaming platforms are optimized for throughput and real-time processing, not for ad-hoc querying or historical analysis. This makes it difficult for analysts to explore past data or perform complex analyses on the fly.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="Black Box"></p><p>This limitation can significantly impact a team&#39;s ability to derive timely insights from their streaming data. To illustrate this challenge more concretely, let&#39;s consider a common use case in the e-commerce industry.</p><h4 id="example-user-analytics-in-e-commerce" tabindex="-1">Example: User Analytics in E-commerce <a class="header-anchor" href="#example-user-analytics-in-e-commerce" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example: User Analytics in E-commerce&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Imagine an e-commerce platform using Amazon Kinesis to stream user behavior data.

Vendor lock-in can make it difficult and expensive to switch to another provider or bring operations in-house. In terms of cost, while managed services often have higher upfront pricing, they can potentially reduce operational expenses by eliminating the need for in-house infrastructure management and specialized personnel. The total cost of ownership depends on factors such as scaling needs and existing resources. Regarding data ownership, using a managed service means entrusting data storage and management to a third party. This can raise concerns about data control, access, portability, and compliance, although many services offer security measures and options for increased data control.</p><p>For teams willing to navigate these trade-offs, managed services can often be a great option, providing scalability and specialized capabilities without the complexity of maintaining a custom infrastructure. If going the managed route, each service comes with its own set of considerations in terms of deployment complexity, underlying database, and integration capabilities.</p><h3 id="diy-infrastructure" tabindex="-1">DIY Infrastructure <a class="header-anchor" href="#diy-infrastructure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;DIY Infrastructure&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Alternatively, teams opting for a do-it-yourself (DIY) solution would need to develop and maintain their own infrastructure and tooling, mirroring the capabilities offered by managed services such as Tinybird.</p><p>The DIY route offers maximum flexibility and control over your data and infrastructure. It allows for deep customization to meet specific needs and can potentially be more cost-effective at large scales. However, it requires in-house expertise in areas such as data engineering and infrastructure management.
